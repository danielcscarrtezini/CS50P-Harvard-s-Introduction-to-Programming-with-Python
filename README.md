# CS50P-Harvard-s-Introduction-to-Programming-with-Python

This repository contains my practice exercises from CS50P, Harvard's introduction to programming with Python. Here, youâ€™ll find a series of exercises based on real-world programming problems.

Throughout this course, I learn how to:

Handle exceptions, find and fix bugs, and write unit tests
Use third-party libraries
Validate and extract data with regular expressions
Model real-world entities using classes, objects, methods, and properties
Read and write files
